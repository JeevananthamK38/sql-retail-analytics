# Retail Analytics – SQL Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing employee and sales data for a retail company using SQL.
The objective is to derive meaningful business insights related to employee performance,
department-wise analysis, and sales contribution.

## Business Context
A retail organization wants to understand:
- Employee distribution across departments
- Salary patterns
- Sales performance at employee and department level
- Top performing employees based on sales

## Database Schema
The project uses the following tables:
- `departments` – department details
- `employees` – employee information including salary and department
- `sales` – sales transactions made by employees

## Key Analysis Performed
- Employees with their department names
- Employee count and average salary per department
- Employees earning above company average salary
- Total sales by employee and department
- Employees with no sales
- Ranking employees based on total sales
- Identifying top performing employees

## SQL Concepts Used
- Joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN)
- Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX)
- GROUP BY and HAVING
- Subqueries
- Window functions (RANK)
- Business logic filtering

## Files in This Repository
- `retail_sales_employee_analysis.sql` – Contains table creation, data insertion, and all analysis queries.

## Purpose
This project demonstrates my practical understanding of SQL for data analysis
and my ability to solve real-world business problems using structured queries.
